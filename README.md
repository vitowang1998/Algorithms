# Algorithms
This repository contains the algorithms I learned. 


# About
Most of the algorithms are written in C++ due to efficiency considerations. It is easy to adapt the codes into other languages like Java, Python, or Pascal. I actually use Java much more than C++ in developing softwares.


# IDE
XCode version 8.2
